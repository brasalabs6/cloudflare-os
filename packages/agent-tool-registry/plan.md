# Agent Tool Registry and Capability Projection — plan.md

> **State:** NOT STARTED (except for source analysis stated below). These are executable work packages, not an assertion of completed code. Implementation must proceed only after prerequisite API reviews, migrations and security approval.

## 0. Inputs, sources and dependencies

**User requirement:** [USER_INPUT_LEDGER U-006/U-007](../../docs/architecture/USER_INPUT_LEDGER.md). **Normative:** [Unified v2](../../docs/architecture/AGENT_PLATFORM_UNIFIED_V2.md), [ACC package](../agent-protocol/SPECS.md), [ACP v1](../../docs/architecture/ACP_CONTRACTS_V1.md). **Feature evidence:** [migration matrix](../../docs/architecture/ACP_MIGRATION_MATRIX.md).

**Destillation sources:** Existing packages/workshop-shared/src/gatekeeper.ts, packages/mcp-shared/src/tools.ts, gatekeeper-mcp and gatekeeper-mcp-portal; Workshop executeCode bindings.

**Dependencies:** preserve existing Workshop kernel authority, current Gatekeeper observer/action approval semantics, current Scheduler hooks and MCP import trust. No inherited auth data is accepted from an untrusted serialized request. Pin source path+commit before porting.

## 1. Ordered implementation steps

- [ ] **P01 — Inventory GatekeeperVendor/User/Session discovery, executeCode env binding and mcp-shared tools.ts classification/limits; document exact reuse points.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

- [ ] **P02 — Define versioned ToolManifest, ToolBinding, ToolInvocation and filtered catalog schemas plus per-version stable IDs.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

- [ ] **P03 — Implement schema validation, discovery normalization and collision-safe tool IDs without treating metadata as authorization.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

- [ ] **P04 — Build the Workshop capability resolver that checks current grant, observer and workspace, with no direct serialized RpcStub crossing HTTP.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

- [ ] **P05 — Implement projection adapters: native executeCode descriptive types, ACP harness tool/MCP bindings and future outbound tool gateway.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

- [ ] **P06 — Keep mcp-shared as sole MCP import/OAuth/classification authority; map its scoped tools without copying trust logic.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

- [ ] **P07 — Implement invocation status, action staging, approval replay, quotas and idempotency with typed UNKNOWN outcomes.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

- [ ] **P08 — Write negative tests for revoked scopes, untrusted readOnlyHint, unsafe dynamic schemas, bypass attempts and tool catalog churn.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

- [ ] **P09 — Provide example pluggable tool module with independent deployment and prove it works through native and ACP consumers.**
  - Deliverable: source/code change or schema plus focused test fixture and exact path/commit trace.
  - Gate: reviewer checks backward compatibility, security boundary and that evidence is stored in the migration ledger.

```

## 3. Contract, migration and release gates

- [ ] **Contracts:** strict TS types, JSON Schema, positive/negative fixtures, versioned errors and valid capability negotiation.
- [ ] **Persistence:** list authoritative storage records, unique indexes, state transitions, idempotency, DO transaction ordering and migration rollback. If no DB, explicitly document stateless ownership.
- [ ] **Security:** workspace/principal/grants, least privilege, approval-vs-observation, foreign protocol input validation, secrets redaction and audit. No bypass of existing Gatekeepers.
- [ ] **Failure:** crash-before/after-dispatch, duplicate deliveries, stale revisions/generations, timeout UNKNOWN outcome, pause/stop/revoke and cleanup.
- [ ] **Operability:** bounded concurrency, memory/CPU/IO/time/token/cost quotas, metrics (no prompts/secrets), operator diagnostics and alerts.
- [ ] **Release:** local build/lint/config checks, worker integration/E2E, immutable release test, A/B sticky routing where applicable, canary rollback; no silent breaking schema.
- [ ] **Extraction closure:** for every related Grokbot F-001…F-017/Hub/native behavior, record origin repo/commit/path → target file/tests/staging evidence or explicit defer reason.

## 4. Minimum acceptance

Tool manifest schema, discover/list scope, live permission revocation, time-of-check vs apply, external HTTP/MCP parity, unknown tool, oversize inputs, no direct runtime bypass and observer restrictions.

**Done only when** every checked item has code and test links, plus an actual release/deploy reference if this package produces a Worker. No long-running autonomous loop or public MCP API is "done" based solely on mocks.
